```

### For Different User Types

#### **Beginners**

- Primary: `nlp-teaching-strategies.md`
- Support: `windows-setup-guide.md`
- Reference: `notebook-development-guide.md`

#### **Intermediate Users**

- Primary: `notebook-development-guide.md`

## üìä Prompt Effectiveness Guidelines

### When to Use Multiple Prompts

- **Complex Tasks**: Combine 2-3 related prompts
- **Teaching Contexts**: Always include `nlp-teaching-strategies.md`
- **Windows Environments**: Include `windows-setup-guide.md`
- **Performance-Critical Work**: Add `performance-optimization.md`

### Prompt Priority Order

1. **Task-Specific Primary Prompt** (notebook development, teaching, etc.)
2. **Platform-Specific Support** (Windows setup if relevant)
3. **Quality Enhancement** (performance, workflow as needed)

### Customization Guidelines

- **Modify Examples**: Adapt code examples to specific use cases
- **Add Context**: Include repository-specific information
- **Update Versions**: Keep library versions current
- **Local Adaptations**: Adjust for specific hardware/software constraints

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices for Prompt Usage

### Do's

- ‚úÖ Combine complementary prompts for comprehensive guidance
- ‚úÖ Update prompts as repository evolves
- ‚úÖ Use specific sections relevant to current task
- ‚úÖ Maintain consistency across all implementations
- ‚úÖ Test all provided code examples

### Don'ts

- ‚ùå Use prompts blindly without understanding context
- ‚ùå Ignore Windows-specific considerations
- ‚ùå Skip educational value for performance gains
- ‚ùå Implement without testing on target environment
- ‚ùå Forget to update version dependencies

## üîß Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Updates Needed

- **Library Versions**: Update pinned versions in requirements
- **Code Examples**: Test and update code patterns
- **Best Practices**: Incorporate new learning from community
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Update timing estimates

### Community Contributions

- **Issue Reports**: Document problems with prompt guidance
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Propose better patterns or explanations
- **New Use Cases**: Add patterns for additional scenarios
- **Testing Results**: Share outcomes from different environments

## üìû Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Prompt Conflicts**: When multiple prompts have different recommendations
- **Version Mismatches**: When examples use outdated library versions
- **Platform Differences**: When Windows-specific guidance doesn't work
- **Performance Problems**: When optimization suggestions don't help

### Resolution Strategy

1. **Check Prompt Compatibility**: Ensure prompts work together
2. **Verify Environment**: Confirm setup matches prompt assumptions
3. **Test Incrementally**: Apply one prompt's guidance at a time
4. **Document Issues**: Report problems for prompt improvement
